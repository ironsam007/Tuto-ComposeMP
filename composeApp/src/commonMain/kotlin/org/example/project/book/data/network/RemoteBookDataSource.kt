/*
=> "KtorRemoteBookDataSource" cannot be used app wide(in viewModel, domain layer) because is will violate clean Arch:
Presentation -> Domain <- Data. To work around this, u need to implement its function signature in domain(abstraction) and then  use app wide.

=> In our case, we have multiple data sources, so an abstraction is already needed on Repository level which can be used app wide.
=> As a consequence of this, we can keep another abstraction decalred in /data in order to use SearchBookDto as a return type.
